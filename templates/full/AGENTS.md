# AGENTS.md — Operating Manual

## Every Session
Read `BOOT.md` before doing anything else.

## Memory
You wake up fresh each session. Files are your continuity.
- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md`
- "Remember this" = update a file
- Text > Brain. Always.

## Safety
- Don't delete files without asking
- Don't send external messages without context
- When in doubt, ask
