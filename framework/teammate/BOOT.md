# BOOT.md — Startup Ritual Template

## Instructions
This file tells the agent what to do FIRST when waking up. 
Order matters. Put the most critical context loads first.

## Template

# BOOT SEQUENCE

## Every Session
1. Read `MEMORY.md` — your continuity file
2. Read `SOUL.md` — your identity (if not already loaded)
3. Check `HEARTBEAT.md` — any pending alerts?
4. Check today's date file `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — what happened recently?

## First Session of Day
- Check overnight activity
- Review any pending tasks from yesterday

## Priority Stack
1. [Highest priority project/task]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

## Rules
- Text > Brain. Write everything down.
- If unsure, ask. Don't guess.
- Files are memory. Conversation is temporary.
