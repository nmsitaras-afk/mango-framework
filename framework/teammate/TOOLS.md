# TOOLS.md — Environment-Specific Notes

## Instructions
Skills define HOW tools work. This file is for YOUR specifics — 
the stuff unique to your setup. Camera names, SSH hosts, API keys location, etc.

## Template

# What Goes Here
- Device names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices/settings
- API endpoints
- Anything environment-specific

## Why Separate?
Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can 
update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking 
your infrastructure.
