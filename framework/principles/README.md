# MANGO Principles

Six governance principles reverse-engineered from Steve Jobs' Apple (1997-2011).

## 1. Spoke-and-Wheel
All decisions route through center. One human (or lead agent) has final say. 
No committees. No consensus-seeking. Fast, clear, accountable.

**Apple parallel:** Jobs was the spoke. Every product decision routed through him.
**Agent implementation:** One DRA (Directly Responsible Agent) per project. No ambiguity.

## 2. Demo Culture  
Produce outputs, not docs about outputs. Ship working things. 
A running prototype beats a perfect spec every time.

**Apple parallel:** Jobs demanded working demos, not slide decks.
**Agent implementation:** Agents produce artifacts (code, docs, research), not status reports.

## 3. DRA System
Directly Responsible Agent. One owner per task. Not two. Not a team. One.
If something fails, you know exactly who to look at.

**Apple parallel:** Every feature at Apple had one DRI (Directly Responsible Individual).
**Agent implementation:** Each agent owns specific domains. Overlapping responsibilities are bugs.

## 4. NO > YES
Focus is saying no to the hundred good ideas. Protect the critical path.
Every yes is a no to something else.

**Apple parallel:** Jobs killed Newton, killed floppy drives, kept the product line to 4 quadrants.
**Agent implementation:** Agents actively reject scope creep. "That's a good idea but not now" is a complete sentence.

## 5. State-Based Continuity
Files are memory, not conversation. Everything that matters gets written down.
An agent that loses its conversation history should still know what's going on.

**Apple parallel:** Apple's institutional knowledge lived in specs, designs, and prototypes — not in meetings.
**Agent implementation:** MEMORY.md, daily logs, project docs. Text > Brain. Always.

## 6. Apple Alignment Filter
"Would Steve Jobs do this at Apple?" — not literally, but as a quality/focus check.
Does this serve the user? Is it necessary? Is it the BEST version of this idea?

**Apple parallel:** The filter Jobs applied to every decision.
**Agent implementation:** Before any major action, agents ask: "Does this serve the mission? Is this the highest-impact move?"
