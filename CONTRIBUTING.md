# Contributing to MANGO 🥭

We welcome contributions! Here's how to help:

## What We Need
- **Examples** — Real-world agent team configurations
- **Integration guides** — How to use MANGO with other frameworks
- **Principle refinements** — Better explanations, edge cases, anti-patterns
- **Templates** — New starter templates for specific use cases

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b my-contribution`)
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a PR with a clear description

## What We Don't Need
- Code libraries (MANGO is a methodology, not a codebase)
- Breaking changes to the 6 principles
- Vendor-specific lock-in

## Style
- Write in clear, direct language
- Include practical examples
- Cite sources when making claims
- Keep files focused (one concept per file)
